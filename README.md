### Ruby/Python Developer

Decided to switch my own professional career to software development after 10+ years on retail.
While being a self-employed merchant I have designed my own online store based on Opencart CMS.
It was really exciting experience.
Now the software development is what I want to do.

Hard Skills:
- Ruby/Rails
- JS/React

- Git/GitHub 
- Linux
- Rspec
- Hotwire/Stimulus
