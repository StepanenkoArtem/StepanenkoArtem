### Ruby/Python Developer

Decided to switch my own professional career to software development after 10+ years on retail.
While being a self-employed merchant I have designed my own online store based on Opencart CMS.
It was really exciting experience.
Now the software development is what I want to do.

Hard Skills:
- Python 3+
- Basic knowledge about HTML+CSS, SQL
- Git/GitHub 
- OOP
- Linux

Soft Skills:
- Strong attention to details
- Technical background
- It is normal for me to constantly learn new skills and knowledge.
