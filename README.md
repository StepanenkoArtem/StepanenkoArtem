### Junior Python Developer

- ðŸ”­ Looking for Junior Python Software Developer job.

Decided to switch my own professional career to software development after 10+ years on retail.
While being a self-employed merchant I have designed my own online store based on Opencart CMS.
It was really exciting experience.
Now the software development is what I want to do.
I study Python last year on education platform Hexlet.io (https://ru.hexlet.io/u/stepanenkoartem)

Hard Skills:
- Python 3+
- Django
- Basic knowledge about HTML+CSS, SQL
- Git/GitHub
- TDD
- OOP
- Linux

Soft Skills:
- Strong attention to details
- Technical background
- It is normal for me to constantly learn new skills and knowledge.

I am looking for a team job that will allow me to grow as a specialist.

Test-driven development, code review and mentoring are practices what I want to face.
