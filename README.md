### Fullstack Software Engineer (RoR + React)

Decided to switch my own professional career to software development after 10+ years on retail.
While being a self-employed merchant I have designed my own online store based on Opencart CMS.
It was really exciting experience.

Since I became the software engineer from March 2021 I have worked on Ruby on Rails projects as fullstack sofware engineer. Gained good experience building API backend for web applications using REST API and GraphQL. Familiar with React/Redux Toolkit, Docker, HTML/CSS3. Test-driven-development oriented.

Hard Skills:
- Ruby/Rails
- Rspec
- JS/React
- Redux/Redux toolkit
- Hotwire/Stimulus
- Git/GitHub 
- Linux
